2D Problems 
1) DFS on 2D grid 
2) BFS on 2D grid 
3) Counting connected rooms cses problem(counting connected components)----> DFS problem 
4) Jungle run(Shortest path between 2 grid points) ---> BFS problem 
5) Minimum Knight Moves(GFG) ---------> BFS problem 
6) Rotten Oranges(BFS) ----------> BFS problem

Note the difference between the above 2 and understand where DFS is used and where BFS is used... !!!
