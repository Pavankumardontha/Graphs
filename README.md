# Standard Algorithms
1) DFS
2) BFS
3) Articulation points and bridges (notice the difference)
4) Topological Sort
5) Dijkstra 
6) Floyd warshall
7) Bellmanford 
8) Krushkal minimum spanning tree
9) Kosaraju strongly connected components

# BFS 
1) Diameter of a Tree
2) Get watched videos by your friends (leetcode)
3) Word ladder - 1 (leetcode)
4) Word ladder - 2 (leetcode)

# DFS
1) No. of islands (leetcode)
2) Flood fill (leetcode)
3) Check if path exists between source and destination node (leetcode)
4) No. of paths between source and destination nodes (+ backtracking)
5) Shortest/Largest path between source and destion node (+ backtracking)
6) Count connected components in a graph
7) Bipartite graph check
8) Keys and rooms (leetcode)

# Minimum spanning Tree 
1) Redundant connection (leetcode)
2) 



# Dijkstra 
1) No. of ways to arrive destination

# Problem Set
1) Non-directed graph cycle detection
2) Directed graph cycle detection

# 2D Problem Set 
1) DFS on 2D grid 
2) BFS on 2D grid 
3) Counting connected rooms cses problem(counting connected components) ----> DFS problem 
4) Largest Area of 1's in 2D grid ------------> DFS problem
5) Jungle run(Shortest path between 2 grid points) ---> BFS problem 
6) Minimum Knight Moves(GFG) ---------> BFS problem 
7) Rotten Oranges(Important model) ----------> BFS problem
8) Swim In Rising Water ---------> Dijshiktra 
9) Path with minimum effort------>Dijshiktra

Note the difference between the above 2 and understand where DFS is used and where BFS is used. Understand where to use Priority queue(Dijshiktra) and where to use simple queue(BFS) for a problem. This is very very important !!!
