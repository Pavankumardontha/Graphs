# Standard Algorithms
1) DFS
2) BFS
3) Articulation points and bridges (notice the difference)
4) Topological Sort
5) Dijkstra 
6) Floyd warshall
7) Bellmanford 
8) Krushkal minimum spanning tree
9) Kosaraju strongly connected components

# BFS problems 
1) Get watched videos by your friends


# Problem Set
1) count connected components 
2) Bipartite graph
3) Non-directed graph cycle detection
4) Directed graph cycle detection
5) Diameter of a tree

# 2D Problem Set 
1) DFS on 2D grid 
2) BFS on 2D grid 
3) Counting connected rooms cses problem(counting connected components) ----> DFS problem 
4) Largest Area of 1's in 2D grid ------------> DFS problem
5) Jungle run(Shortest path between 2 grid points) ---> BFS problem 
6) Minimum Knight Moves(GFG) ---------> BFS problem 
7) Rotten Oranges(Important model) ----------> BFS problem
8) Swim In Rising Water ---------> Dijshiktra 
9) Path with minimum effort------>Dijshiktra

Note the difference between the above 2 and understand where DFS is used and where BFS is used. Understand where to use Priority queue(Dijshiktra) and where to use simple queue(BFS) for a problem. This is very very important !!!
