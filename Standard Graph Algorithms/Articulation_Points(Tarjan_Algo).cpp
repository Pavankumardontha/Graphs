/*
A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) if removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. 
Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components. 
They are useful for designing reliable networks.For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of
connected components.
